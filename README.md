# Fast Food
This is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application that is to 
replicate purchasing goods from a fast food restuarant. It uses the MVVM 
(Model, View, View Model) framework to do so, despite the project's 
smaller size. This is meant to be a learning experience for me and to 
help me learn more about C#, WPF, and the MVVM framework. I might 
include Prism at a later time.
